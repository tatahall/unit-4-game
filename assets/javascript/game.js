//goal of the game is to click on the crystals to match the
//computers randomly generated number.

//create variable for computer's random guess

//create variables wins and losses

//create variable for total score: total score should be an accumulation of points from the crystals clicked

//create variables for crystals' random value. crystal value should be hidden, but don't think special
//coding needed to hide them so much as not display them.

//create variable/function for game reset:
    //total score reset to 0;
    //new computer guess generated;
    //new crystal values/guesses generated;

//if user's score === computer number:
    //wins++
    //game resets
    //alert "you win"

//if user's score !== computer number:
    //losses++
    //game resets
    //alert "you lose"
